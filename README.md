## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Three.js** â€“ JavaScript 3D library for rendering and interactive graphics.  
- **HTML5 & CSS3** â€“ UI elements and overlays.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Game logic, controls, and procedural generation.  

> Three.js is a powerful library for **computer graphics**, enabling developers to create **interactive 3D graphics** directly in the browser. Terraverse uses it to demonstrate **lighting, shading, camera controls, procedural terrain, and real-time block interactions**.
